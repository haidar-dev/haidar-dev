## Principles

- Truly beginner friendly
- Keep it simple for a quick guide
- Show why and what React is with some visuals
- Start with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Start with CDN at first without extra tooling
- Recommend and refer back to the official docs and references, as this isn't the whole technical docs
- Recommend initial workflow to use JSX autocomplete like Emmet and formatter like Prettier before anything else
- Recommend to understand and use the difference between SPA vs non-SPA, CRA the old way, Vite, Next.js, Remix, Gatsby, Astro, etc
- Recommend TypeScript for type safety and ESLint for code quality check
- Recommend popular options on routing (ex: React Router), styling (ex: Tailwind CSS), UI components (ex: Radix UI), data fetching (ex: SWR, React Query)
